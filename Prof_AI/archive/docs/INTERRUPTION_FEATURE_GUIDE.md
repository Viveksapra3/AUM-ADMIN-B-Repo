# 🛑 Interruption Feature (Barge-In) - Complete Guide

## ✅ **NOW ENABLED: You CAN Interrupt the Agent!**

---

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Scenario 1: Normal Conversation (No Interruption)**

```
1. User: "Tell me about AUM programs"
2. Agent starts speaking: "Auburn University at Montgomery offers..."
3. User stays quiet
4. Agent finishes speaking
5. Microphone unmutes after 1 second
6. User can speak again
```

---

### **Scenario 2: User Interrupts Agent (Barge-In)**

```
1. User: "Tell me about AUM programs"
2. Agent starts speaking: "Auburn University at Montgomery offers..."
3. User interrupts: "WAIT!" (speaks loudly)
   ↓
4. 🛑 INTERRUPTION DETECTED!
   ↓
5. Agent's audio STOPS immediately
6. Microphone UNMUTES immediately
7. User's speech is captured: "WAIT! Just tell me about computer science"
8. Agent responds to the new question
```

**Result:** ✅ **Agent stops, listens, and responds to your interruption!**

---

## 🔧 **How Interruption Detection Works**

### **Technical Implementation:**

```javascript
// Interruption threshold: 1.5x normal VAD threshold
if (isAgentSpeaking && smoothedRMS > VAD_THRESHOLD * 1.5) {
    // User is speaking LOUDLY while agent talks
    
    // 1. Stop agent's audio immediately
    currentAudioSource.stop();
    
    // 2. Unmute microphone
    isAgentSpeaking = false;
    
    // 3. Emit interruption event
    emitAvatarEvent('agent_interrupted');
    
    // 4. Process user's speech normally
}
```

---

## 📊 **Interruption Threshold**

| Condition | Threshold | Behavior |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Normal speech detection** | `0.02` | Detects user speech when quiet |
| **Interruption detection** | `0.03` (1.5x) | Requires **louder** speech to interrupt |
| **Noise gate** | `0.005` | Ignores very quiet sounds |

**Why 1.5x threshold?**
- Prevents accidental interruptions from background noise
- Requires **intentional, clear speech** to interrupt
- Reduces false positives

---

## 🎭 **Avatar Events for Interruption**

### **New Event:**

```javascript
window.addEventListener('avatarEvent', (e) => {
    if (e.detail.type === 'agent_interrupted') {
        // Agent was interrupted by user
        console.log('🛑 Agent interrupted!');
        
        // Your avatar code:
        avatar.stopSpeaking();      // Stop lip-sync
        avatar.showListening();     // Show listening state
        avatar.cancelGestures();    // Stop any gestures
    }
});
```

---

## 🎯 **Complete Event Flow**

### **With Interruption:**

```
1. agent_speaking_start
   → Avatar starts speaking, lip-sync begins
   
2. [User interrupts]
   
3. agent_interrupted ⭐ NEW EVENT
   → Avatar stops speaking immediately
   → Avatar shows listening state
   
4. user_speaking_start
   → Avatar listens to user
   
5. user_transcript
   → Display what user said
   
6. agent_response
   → New response from agent
   
7. agent_speaking_start
   → Avatar speaks new response
```

---

## 🔊 **Audio Behavior**

### **What Happens to Agent's Audio:**

```javascript
// Agent is speaking
currentAudioSource.start(0);

// User interrupts
currentAudioSource.stop(); // ← STOPS IMMEDIATELY

// Audio cuts off mid-sentence
// No fade-out, instant stop
```

**Example:**
```
Agent: "Auburn University at Montgomery offers over 90 degree prog—"
         ↑ Interrupted here
User: "Just tell me about computer science"
Agent: "Our Computer Science program..."
```

---

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

### **Adjust Interruption Sensitivity:**

```javascript
// In avatar-audio-client.html, line ~601

// LESS SENSITIVE (harder to interrupt)
if (isAgentSpeaking && smoothedRMS > VAD_THRESHOLD * 2.0) {
    // Requires 2x louder speech
}

// MORE SENSITIVE (easier to interrupt)
if (isAgentSpeaking && smoothedRMS > VAD_THRESHOLD * 1.2) {
    // Requires only 1.2x louder speech
}

// CURRENT (balanced)
if (isAgentSpeaking && smoothedRMS > VAD_THRESHOLD * 1.5) {
    // Requires 1.5x louder speech
}
```

## 🎯 **Testing Interruption**

### **Test Cases:**

#### **Test 1: Successful Interruption**
```
1. Start voice session
2. Ask: "Tell me about all AUM programs"
3. Agent starts long response
4. Interrupt loudly: "STOP!"
5. ✅ Agent should stop immediately
6. ✅ Your "STOP!" should be transcribed
7. ✅ Agent responds to "STOP!"
```

#### **Test 2: Background Noise (Should NOT Interrupt)**
```
1. Agent is speaking
2. Quiet background noise (typing, etc.)
3. ✅ Agent should continue speaking
4. ✅ No interruption detected
```

#### **Test 3: Soft Speech (Should NOT Interrupt)**
```
1. Agent is speaking
2. You whisper something
3. ✅ Agent should continue speaking
4. ✅ Requires louder speech to interrupt
```

## 🎊 **Comparison: Before vs After**

### **BEFORE (No Interruption):**

```
User: "Tell me about all programs"
Agent: [Speaks for 30 seconds about all programs]
User: [Wants to interrupt but can't]
User: [Waits for agent to finish]
User: [Finally can speak after 30+ seconds]
```

**Problem:** ❌ User must wait for entire response

---

### **AFTER (With Interruption):**

```
User: "Tell me about all programs"
Agent: "Auburn University offers over 90—"
User: "WAIT! Just computer science"
Agent: [STOPS immediately]
Agent: "Our Computer Science program offers..."
```

**Solution:** ✅ User can interrupt anytime!

---

## 🔧 **Advanced: Interruption Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Immediate Stop (Current)**
```javascript
// Agent stops immediately when interrupted
currentAudioSource.stop();
```

**Pros:** Fast, responsive  
**Cons:** Abrupt cutoff

---

### **Strategy 2: Fade Out (Smoother)**
```javascript
// Fade out agent's audio over 200ms
const gainNode = audioContext.createGain();
source.connect(gainNode);
gainNode.connect(audioContext.destination);

// On interruption
gainNode.gain.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(
    0.01, 
    audioContext.currentTime + 0.2
);
setTimeout(() => source.stop(), 200);
```

**Pros:** Smoother transition  
**Cons:** 200ms delay

---

### **Strategy 3: Smart Interruption**
```javascript
// Only allow interruption after agent speaks for 2+ seconds
let agentSpeakingStartTime = Date.now();

if (isAgentSpeaking && 
    smoothedRMS > VAD_THRESHOLD * 1.5 &&
    Date.now() - agentSpeakingStartTime > 2000) {
    // Allow interruption
}
```

**Pros:** Prevents accidental early interruptions  
**Cons:** Must wait 2 seconds

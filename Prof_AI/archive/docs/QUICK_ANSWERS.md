# ⚡ Quick Answers - Your Questions

## ❓ **Can I interrupt when agent speaks?**

### ✅ **YES! You can now interrupt the agent.**

---

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### **Before (Old Version):**
```
Agent speaking → Microphone MUTED → You CANNOT interrupt
                                   → Must wait until agent finishes
```

### **After (New Version - NOW ACTIVE):**
```
Agent speaking → You speak LOUDLY → Agent STOPS immediately
                                   → Microphone UNMUTES
                                   → Your speech is captured
                                   → Agent responds to your interruption
```

## 📊 **Step-by-Step Example:**

### **Scenario: You want to interrupt**

```
1. You ask: "Tell me about all AUM programs"

2. Agent starts: "Auburn University at Montgomery offers over 90 
   degree programs across various fields including business, 
   education, liberal arts, nursing, sciences..."
   
3. You interrupt (speak loudly): "WAIT! Just tell me about 
   computer science"
   
4. 🛑 INTERRUPTION DETECTED!
   
5. Agent's audio STOPS immediately (mid-sentence)
   
6. Microphone UNMUTES
   
7. Your interruption is transcribed: "WAIT! Just tell me about 
   computer science"
   
8. Agent responds: "Our Computer Science program offers Bachelor's 
   and Master's degrees..."
```
